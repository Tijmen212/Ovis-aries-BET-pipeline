Pipeline created as part of 2024 BBSRC rotation 1 for the skullstripping of sheep T1 and fMRI data

This was created on a MAC system useing VS Code. 
To run the notebooks locally use the 'environment' file to install the required libraries. 

There is an accompanying poster for which the references are below.
